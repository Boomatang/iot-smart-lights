# IOT Smart Lights
#### Student Name: Jim Fitzpatrick   Student ID: 03021351

The aim of the project is to show how a network work enable light system could be used in a house to provide usefully features, such as letting a user know when the last person leaves the house and has left a light on. With the rise in IOT enable everything I want to focus on if a house was been build to have IOT lights from the start and not been retro fitted to an existing house.

For the system of control there would be one main unit in a house which lights and switches could be wired into. Each light and switch would be seen as a device in the system. This would mean a remote switch could be assigned to any number of lights. As a second method of control the system could be controlled from a web interface or a mobile app. In this example a chat client will be used to demo some app features.

Some of the features the project aims to demonstrate are.
* Remote turning on and off of lights by web interface or chat client
* Local tuning on and off of lights by buttons
* Inform user to what lights are on and off
* Inform a user that everyone has left the house and there is a light left on
* Allow the programming of a button to multiply lights at one time.
